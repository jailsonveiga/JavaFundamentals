                              TERMS OF ART "JAVA"
                          Variables in Java Program:

-- Variables: In Java we use variables to temporarily store data in computer's memory.

-- There are three types of variables in Java:
   - local variable "variable declared inside the body of the method"
   - instance variable "variable inside the class but outside the body of the method"
   - static variable "variable declared as a static"

Example:
-- Initializing

DataType - identifier - assignment operator - value
  int         age                 =            30;     "30 initial value"

-- int datatype: Can only store integers "int datatype" which are whole numbers.
-- We are storing value of number 30 somewhere in a computer's memory
-- We are Assigning the identifier "label" to that memory location
