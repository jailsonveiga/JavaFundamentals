                            Primitive Vs Reference Data Type in Java Program:

--Primitive Data Type: For storing simple values
--Reference Data Type: For storing complex objects
--Reference types are copied by the references whereas primitive types are copied by their value
  --these values are completely independent of each other

example of primitive data type:

byte x = 1;
byte y = x;

-- we are assigning value of 1 into variable x
-- we are assigning value of variable x into variable y
-- variable x and variable y is complete different from each other
-- variable x and variable y is stored in different memory location
-- if we change value of x, y is not going to get affected

x = 2;

-- changing the initial value of x (1) to value of 2

System.out.println(y);

-- output (y)
   -- 1

//Example of Reference Data Type:

--Point point1 = new Point(x:1, y:1);
  --inside the point parenthesis we can pass initial values for x and y

--Point point2 = point1;
  --we are copying the value of variable point1 into variable point2

--this two variable (point1 and point2) are not independent of each other
--they are referencing the same object
--if I change the value of any of these variables (point1 or point2) changes will be visible to the other variable

point.x = 2;

--we use the (.) operator to see the members of this object (x, y)

System.out.println(point2);

--print out the value of the variable point2  output -> (2) to the terminal
